# allerpegel
A datamining project that collects, saves and visualizes water levels of the river Aller at "Pegel Eitze". 

The https://www.nlwkn.niedersachsen.de provides data about the water levels of all rivers in Lower Saxony for the last 30 days. For those who are interested in longer time spans this code saves the water levels every hour and visualizes it once a day.
